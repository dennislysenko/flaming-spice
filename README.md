Game for the VT incarnation of the 2014 Global Game Jam.

Alterego: http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/alterego

This game was based on the quote: "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." We took this quote to mean that one's upbringing and experiences affect how the see the world. Alterego is a more literal example of that interpretation. The player controls a character using WASD and the mouse, and can change between a set of different personas, or egos. Each ego has benefits and drawbacks, as well as an associated backstory that explains why they see the world as they do.
